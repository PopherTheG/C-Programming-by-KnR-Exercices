# C-Programming-by-KnR-Exercices
My solutions for the exercises in the famous KnR book.

Note: Not doing all the exercises, only am choosing one's that are fun and challenging to solve for me. 
If a certain exercise is challening and is not here, probably I find it too hard to solve or I am not 
there yet.
